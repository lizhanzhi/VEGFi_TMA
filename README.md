Overview
This repository contains the analysis code and datasets used to generate Figures 2â€“5 in the manuscript titled "Linking Preclinical Models to Clinical Realities: VEGF/VEGFR Inhibitors and Thrombotic Microangiopathy in Cancer Therapy". The study investigates the association between VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) using pharmacovigilance databases, clinical biomarkers, animal models, and transcriptomic analyses.

This README provides instructions for reproducing the figures and understanding the structure of the code and data.
